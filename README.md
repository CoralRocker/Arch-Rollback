# Arch-Rollback - Develop Branch
The easy way to undo previous upgrades in Arch and other Linux Distributions that use the _pacman_ package manager.

This branch is liable to be unusable at any given moment since it is the branch that is being actively worked on. Stable "releases" will be in the master branch. 

# Dependencies

This program relies upon [Colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama) and Curses to work. Colorama can be installed from github or by running `pip install --user colorama`.


# Installation
Run `git clone https://github.com/CoralRocker/Arch-Rollback.git`. That's it!

### pacman_package class
| Method Name | Parameters | What It Does |
|:---:|---|---|
| \_\_init__ | line=False, regex=False, name=False, ver=False | if given a line and regex, gets the package's update date. If given name and ver, uses it to update the package's name and current version.
